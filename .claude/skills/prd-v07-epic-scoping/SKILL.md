description: Transform v0.6 specifications into context-window-sized work packages (EPICs) during PRD v0.7 Build Execution. Triggers on requests to create epics, scope work, break down implementation, or when user asks "create epics", "scope work", "break down work", "context window sizing", "what to build first?", "implementation planning", "epic breakdown". Consumes API-, DBT-, FEA-, ARC-. Outputs EPIC- entries with objectives, ID references, dependencies, and context windows. Feeds v0.7 Test Planning.

# Epic Scoping

Position in workflow: v0.6 Technical Specification → **v0.7 Epic Scoping** → v0.7 Test Planning

## Core Concept: Epic = Context Window

> An EPIC is not a "big user story." It is a **cognitive boundary**—a scope of work that fits in working memory (human or AI). The goal is to load exactly what's needed to complete a focused task without distraction.

**The question is not** "How long will this take?" but **"Can an agent complete this without needing more context than fits in a session?"**

## Sizing Rules

| Size | Characteristics | Action |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| **Right-sized** | 3-5 API endpoints, 2-4 DBT tables, 1-2 UJ flows | Good fit ✓ |
| **Too big** | >10 APIs, >5 tables, multiple unrelated features | Split by domain |
| **Too small** | Single endpoint, no meaningful deliverable | Merge with related |

**Rule of thumb**: If you can't describe the EPIC's goal in one sentence, it's too big.

## Context Budget Guidelines

EPICs are **context capsules** — work units sized for AI agent handoffs.

| Dimension | Target | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Pre-load context** | <100k tokens | SoT files + EPIC + code references |
| **Working room** | >100k tokens | Space for tool outputs, debugging, iteration |
| **Session goal** | 1 checkpoint | Clear "done" state per session |

**Context Monitoring**: Don't estimate upfront — monitor during work. If context exceeds 100k tokens mid-session, pause and checkpoint immediately.

**Splitting Signal**: If you need to load >5 SoT files or >10 code files to understand the EPIC, it's probably too big.

## Branch Convention

Each EPIC gets its own branch. This creates:
- Clear ownership (one EPIC = one branch = one PR)
- Easy rollback (delete branch, EPIC never happened)
- Natural checkpoint = commit

**Naming**: `epic/EPIC-{NUMBER}-{slug}`

Examples:
- `epic/EPIC-01-auth-endpoints`
- `epic/EPIC-02-user-dashboard`
- `epic/EPIC-03-payment-integration`

**Workflow**:
1. EPIC created → `git checkout -b epic/EPIC-{NUMBER}-{slug}`
2. Work happens → Commits reference IDs in messages
3. Checkpoints → Commit with state saved in EPIC Section 1
4. EPIC complete → PR opened
5. PR merged → Branch deleted, EPIC marked Complete

## Scoping Process

1. **Inventory implementation items** from API-, DBT-, FEA-, ARC-
   - What must be built?

2. **Identify natural boundaries**
   - Feature clusters (features that work together)
   - Data domains (tables that belong together)
   - Architectural seams (module boundaries from ARC-)

3. **Size each potential EPIC** against context window capacity
   - Can an agent hold all relevant IDs in one session?

4. **Sequence EPICs by dependencies**
   - What must be built first?
   - What enables other EPICs?

5. **Create EPIC- entries** with full ID references

6. **Validate**: Can an agent complete this EPIC without needing more context than fits in a session?

## Sequencing Framework

| Order | Priority | Rationale | Examples |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Infrastructure EPICs | Everything depends on these | Auth, DB setup, project scaffold |
| 2 | Core data model EPICs | Foundation for features | User, Workspace, base entities |
| 3 | Critical path EPICs | Journeys that drive KPIs | UJ- that affects KPI-001 |
| 4 | Supporting feature EPICs | Secondary features | Settings, admin, nice-to-haves |

## EPIC Phase Structure

Each EPIC follows 5 phases:

| Phase | Purpose | Activities |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **A: Plan** | Load context | Read EPIC, load referenced IDs, verify Session State |
| **B: Design** | Update specs | Draft/refine ID entries in specs/ before coding |
| **C: Build** | Implement | Work through Context Windows, test-first |
| **D: Validate** | Verify | Run tests, manual checks, traceability audit |
| **E: Finish** | Clean up | Update SoT, archive temp/, mark complete |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Signal | Fix |
|--------------|--------|-----|
| **Epic explosion** | 20+ EPICs for MVP | Consolidate; most MVPs need 3-7 |
| **One mega-EPIC** | Everything in one EPIC | Split by architectural boundary |
| **No ID references** | EPIC without BR-, API-, DBT- links | Every EPIC must reference specs/ |
| **Circular dependencies** | EPIC-01 needs EPIC-02 needs EPIC-01 | Identify shared foundation, extract to EPIC-00 |
| **Context overload** | Agent can't hold full EPIC context | Split into smaller Context Windows |
| **Missing sequencing** | No build order defined | Establish explicit dependency chain |
| **Vague objectives** | "Build the backend" | Specific, measurable: "Implement API-001–005" |

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to Test Planning:

- [ ] All API- and DBT- entries assigned to EPICs
- [ ] No orphaned specifications (everything has an EPIC home)
- [ ] Dependencies form a DAG (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] Each EPIC has clear, measurable deliverables
- [ ] Context Windows defined for each EPIC
- [ ] Sequencing makes sense (foundations first)

## Downstream Connections

EPIC- entries feed into:

| Consumer | What It Uses | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Test Planning** | EPIC scope defines test boundaries | TEST- entries for EPIC-01 scope |
| **Implementation Loop** | EPIC is execution unit | Work happens inside EPIC context |
| **Session Management** | Section 0 tracks progress | Resume from where we left off |
| **Progress Tracking** | EPIC state shows overall progress | 3/7 EPICs complete |
