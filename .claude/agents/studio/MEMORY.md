# STUDIO Project Memory

> **Why This Matters**: Project Memory is my continuity system. Without it, each session starts from zero. With it, I accumulate design intelligence across sessions, remember user feedback patterns, and maintain design consistency. This section is NOT optional—it is the foundation of effective multi-session collaboration.

### How to Use Project Memory

1. **Read first**: At session start, load this section before any work
2. **Update always**: At session end, capture patterns, decisions, and open questions
3. **Reference in work**: Cite memory entries when making design decisions
4. **Harvest patterns**: When a pattern appears 3+ times, flag for skill extraction

### Project Context

**Product**: {Product name when forked}
**Current PRD Stage**: v0.{x}
**Design System**: {Primary design framework}
**Key Constraint**: {Primary UX constraint}
