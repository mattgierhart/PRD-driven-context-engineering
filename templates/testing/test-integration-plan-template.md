# Integration Testing Implementation Plan: {Feature Name}

## 1. Overview

This document tracks the implementation and results of integration tests for the {Feature Name}'s critical user flows, as defined in EPIC-{XXX}.

## 2. Test Coverage Summary

| Test Flow | Target Tests | Tests Written | Tests Passing | Status |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| {Flow 1: e.g., User Registration/Login} | 10 | 0 | 0 | ❌ Not Started |
| {Flow 2: e.g., Document Upload/Processing} | 8 | 0 | 0 | ❌ Not Started |
| {Flow 3: e.g., AI Query Processing} | 8 | 0 | 0 | ❌ Not Started |

## 3. Detailed Test Plan

### 3.1. {Flow 1: User Registration/Login}

*   **Scope:**
    - [ ] Test case 1 (e.g., Complete signup process with email verification)
    - [ ] Test case 2 (e.g., Login with valid/invalid credentials)
    - [ ] Test case 3 (e.g., Password reset flow)
    - [ ] Test case 4 (e.g., Session persistence and JWT refresh)
    - [ ] Test case 5 (e.g., Rate limiting and account lockout)
*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   *(To be filled out by the developer)*
*   **Test Results:**
    ```
    Test Suite: {Flow 1 Name}
    Total Tests: 0
    Passing: 0
    Failing: 0
    Duration: 0ms
    ```

### 3.2. {Flow 2: Document Upload/Processing}

*   **Scope:**
    - [ ] Test case 1 (e.g., Multi-file upload with progress tracking)
    - [ ] Test case 2 (e.g., Full processing pipeline: OCR -> extraction -> embedding)
    - [ ] Test case 3 (e.g., Real-time status updates via WebSockets)
    - [ ] Test case 4 (e.g., Household-based data isolation)
*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   *(To be filled out by the developer)*
*   **Test Results:**
    ```
    Test Suite: {Flow 2 Name}
    Total Tests: 0
    Passing: 0
    Failing: 0
    Duration: 0ms
    ```

## 4. Test Environment Configuration

### Infrastructure
*   **Database:** Test container (e.g., PostgreSQL with pgvector)
*   **Cache:** Test container (e.g., Redis)
*   **External Services:** Mocked (e.g., Stripe, Google AI)

### Environment Variables
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5433/project_test
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6380
NODE_ENV=test
MOCK_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=true
```

## 5. Action Items

1.  [ ] Configure test database, cache, and external service mocks.
2.  [ ] Create test data fixtures and seeding scripts.
3.  [ ] Implement integration tests for {Flow 1}.
4.  [ ] Implement integration tests for {Flow 2}.
5.  [ ] Achieve < 5 minute total test runtime.
6.  [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline.
