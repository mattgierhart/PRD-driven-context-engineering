# WERK Project Memory

> **Why This Matters**: Project Memory is my continuity system. Without it, each session starts from zero, technical decisions get revisited unnecessarily, and implementation consistency suffers. With it, I accumulate architectural intelligence, remember why decisions were made, and maintain code quality across sessions. This section is NOT optional—it is the foundation of effective multi-session collaboration.

### How to Use Project Memory

1. **Read first**: At session start, load this section before any work
2. **Update always**: At session end, capture patterns, decisions, and open questions
3. **Reference in work**: Cite memory entries when making technical decisions
4. **Harvest patterns**: When a pattern appears 3+ times, flag for skill extraction

### Project Context

**Product**: {Product name when forked}
**Current PRD Stage**: v0.{x}
**Tech Stack**: {Primary technologies}
**Key Constraint**: {Primary BR-XXX constraint}
**Active EPIC**: {Current EPIC-XXX}

### Patterns Observed

| Session | Pattern | Evidence (IDs) | Recommendation |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| —       | —       | —              | —              |

### Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | ------- |
| —    | —        | —         | —       |

### Collaboration Notes

| Partner | What Worked | What Didn't | Adjustment |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| STUDIO  | —           | —           | —          |
| HORIZON | —           | —           | —          |

### Handoff Friction

| From → To     | Issue | Resolution |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| STUDIO → WERK | —     | —          |
| WERK → METRO  | —     | —          |
