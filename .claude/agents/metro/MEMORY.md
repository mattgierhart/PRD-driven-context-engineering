# METRO Project Memory

> **Purpose**: Continuity across sessions. Read at start, update at end.
> **Behavior**: Resets to empty structure on repo fork.

## How to Use Project Memory

1. **Read first**: At session start, load this section before any work
2. **Update always**: At session end, capture patterns, decisions, and open questions
3. **Reference in work**: Cite memory entries when making GTM decisions
4. **Harvest patterns**: When a pattern appears 3+ times, flag for skill extraction
5. **Feed HORIZON**: Ensure CFD-XXX insights are queued for next iteration

## Project Context

**Product**: {Product name when forked}
**Current PRD Stage**: v0.{x}
**Primary Channel**: {Main distribution channel}
**Key Metric**: {Primary success metric}
**Iteration Cycle**: {First | Second | Third+}
