# Contributing to Context Engineering

Thank you for helping us refine the **Context Engineering** methodology. This repository is not just a codebase; it is a living system of **Memory as Infrastructure**.

## Core Philosophy

Before contributing, please read:

1.  **[`README.md`](README.md)**: The "Instincts Layer" and Project Dashboard.
2.  **[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)**: The Agent Operating Instructions.

Our goal is to optimize **Context Density**: providing the AI (and humans) with exactly the right information at the right time.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Refine the Methodology

- **Templates**: Improve `specs/templates/` or `epics/EPIC_TEMPLATE.md`.
- **Workflows**: Suggest automation hooks or better ways to manage the "Source of Truth".
- **Documentation**: Clarify the "Rules of the Road" in `README.md`.

### 2. Report Friction

- If you find a "Gate" in the PRD Lifecycle (`README.md#the-prd-lifecycle`) that slows you down without adding value, let us know.
- If the AI struggles to find context, report it as a "Context Leak."

## Getting Started

1.  **Fork & Branch**: Create a branch for your feature or fix.
2.  **Follow the Lifecycle**: Even for meta-changes, we respect the spirit of the **Gated Workflow**.
3.  **Traceability**: If you add a new concept, give it an ID (e.g., `BR-XXX` or `UJ-XXX`) if it's durable.

## Contribution Standards

- **Terminology**: Use "Context Engineering", "Source of Truth", and "Epics" consistent with `README.md`.
- **Links**: Always use relative links to files (e.g., `[Link](README.md)`), not absolute paths.
- **Tone**: Professional, prescriptive, and rigorous.

## Questions?

- Open a GitHub Issue for discussion.
- Check `README.md` for the current status of the methodology.
