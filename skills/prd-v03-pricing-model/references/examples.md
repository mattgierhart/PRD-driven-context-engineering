# Pricing Model Examples

## Good Examples

### 1. Digital Signage — Flat Rate Undercut

**Context**: Digital signage SaaS targeting SMBs (cafes, restaurants, agencies)

**Model Chosen**:
- $5/screen/month flat
- No per-seat fees (unlike competitors at $20-40/screen)
- White-label tier at $100/mo base + $5/screen for agencies

**Competitive Input**:
- ScreenCloud: $20-40/screen/mo
- Yodeck: $8-15/screen/mo
- Most competitors also add per-user fees

**Why It Worked**:
- Clear price leadership (50-75% savings)
- Removed "SMB penalty" (unlimited users included)
- White-label created B2B2C distribution (agencies buy at $5, sell at $15-30)

**Transferable Pattern**:
> When targeting SMBs against enterprise competitors, flat pricing removes complexity and creates dramatic savings headlines.

**BR- Entry Example**:
```
BR-PRC-001: Per-Screen Flat Rate
Rule: $5/screen/month, no per-user fees at any tier
Rationale: 50%+ savings vs ScreenCloud creates price leadership
Evidence: CFD-XXX (competitor pricing matrix)
```

### 2. Asset Management — Location-Based vs Per-User

**Context**: Physical asset tracking for cafes, restaurants, trade contractors

**Model Chosen**:
- $9-15/location/month flat
- No per-seat pricing
- Offline mode included (not paywalled)

**Competitive Input**:
| Competitor | Model | 5-User Annual Cost |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| UpKeep | $45/user/mo | $2,700/year |
| MaintainX | $21/user/mo | $1,260/year |
| Xenia | $99/mo (15 users) | $1,188/year |

**Why It Worked**:
- Calculated SMB penalty: $2,700/year vs $99/year = 96% savings
- Location-based makes sense for asset tracking (value per site, not per person)
- Avoided crippled free tier trap (MaintainX limits to 2 work orders)

**Transferable Pattern**:
> Calculate the "5-user annual cost" for per-seat competitors. If you can offer 70%+ savings with flat pricing, lead with price.

**BR- Entry Example**:
```
BR-CMP-001: Per-User Undercut Positioning
Rule: Marketing must lead with "$99/year vs $2,700/year" comparison
Rationale: 96% savings is the core value proposition
Evidence: CFD-XXX (UpKeep pricing page)
```

### 3. Freemium SaaS — Usage-Capped Free Tier

**Context**: Consumer product (HomeFalcon — home product management)

**Model Chosen**:
- Free: 5 products, 3 issues/month, basic features
- Pro ($19/mo): Unlimited products, all features
- Pro+ ($29/mo): Includes medical bills, insurance guidance
- Add-ons: $10/mo modules

**Why It Worked**:
- Free tier demonstrates value (hook) but has clear limit (5 products)
- Upgrade trigger is usage-based (run out of products), not artificial
- Add-on revenue creates expansion without tier complexity

**Transferable Pattern**:
> Free tier caps should hit naturally as user gets value. "You've added 5 products and HomeFalcon saved you $200 — upgrade for unlimited" is better than "Feature X is Pro only."

**BR- Entry Example**:
```
BR-PKG-001: Free Tier Product Limit
Rule: Free tier capped at 5 products, show upgrade prompt at product 4
Rationale: Enough to demonstrate value, triggers upgrade at success moment
Evidence: Competitor analysis — Notion does similar with blocks
```

## Bad Examples

### 1. Generic Clone Without Differentiation

**Context**: Review management tool copying BirdEye

**Model Chosen**: Matched BirdEye's feature set and pricing tiers

**Failure Mode**:
- Tried to match feature-for-feature (massive build scope)
- No price differentiation
- Competing against well-funded incumbent on their terms
- No niche focus (just "SMBs")

**What Should Have Happened**:
- Pick specific segment (restaurants only, not all SMBs)
- Cut features aggressively (not match them)
- Lead with price ($49/mo vs $299+/mo)

**Anti-Pattern**:
> Clone without differentiation = death. Must have execution edge OR become Undercut with niche focus.

### 2. Innovation Pricing on Fast Follow Product

**Context**: Physical therapy documentation tool

**Model Chosen**: Initially classified as Innovation (new market creation)

**Failure Mode**:
- Priced for "new category" when EMR tools already existed
- Required market education that wasn't funded
- Didn't anchor to existing budget lines

**What Should Have Happened**:
- Classify as Undercut (documentation tools exist)
- Position as "like [EMR] but built for PT at 60% lower cost"
- Use competitor pricing as anchor, not greenfield

**Anti-Pattern**:
> Don't use Innovation pricing (premium, value-based) when you're actually Fast Follow or Undercut. Customers won't pay "new category" prices for problems with existing solutions.

---

### 3. Consumer Innovation Without Budget Evidence

**Context**: Consumer advocate platform (new category)

**Model Chosen**: Freemium with $9.99/month premium

**Failure Mode**:
- No existing budget line for this category
- Required significant market education
- B2C innovation is extremely capital-intensive
- Unclear who the buyer was (consumers? businesses?)

**What Should Have Happened**:
- Validate budget exists before building
- Find proxy budget (what do consumers pay for similar outcomes?)
- Consider if B2B might fund B2C (white-label to insurance companies?)

**Anti-Pattern**:
> Innovation type requires very high confidence (85%+) and clear budget evidence. If you can't find existing spend in adjacent categories, the market may not exist.

## WTP Validation Examples

### Strong Validation (Tier 1-2)

**Landing Page Test**:
- 500 visitors from targeted ads
- 12% clicked "Start Free Trial" with $49/mo price displayed
- 3% entered payment info (even though trial was free)
- **Result**: Strong signal at $49 price point

**Pre-Order Test**:
- 200 email subscribers from content marketing
- Offered 50% discount for annual prepay
- 23 prepaid ($500 in validated revenue)
- **Result**: Tier 1 evidence — actual payment

### Weak Validation (Tier 4-5)

**Survey Only**:
- "Would you pay $49/month for this?" — 60% said yes
- But: Only 5% converted when landing page went live
- **Lesson**: Stated preference ≠ buying behavior

**Gut Feel**:
- "Competitors charge $99, so $49 should work"
- No testing of actual conversion
- **Lesson**: Competitor pricing doesn't validate YOUR WTP

## Pricing Pattern Library

### Pattern: The "Annual Upsell"

```
Monthly: $X
Annual: $X × 10 (17% savings)
Founding: $X × 8 (33% savings, limited time)
```

Rationale: Annual improves cash flow and reduces churn; founding creates urgency.

### Pattern: The "Usage Ceiling"

```
Free: 100 [units]/month
Pro: 1,000 [units]/month
Business: Unlimited
```

Rationale: Caps create natural upgrade moments tied to success.

### Pattern: The "Good-Better-Best"

```
Basic ($X): Core functionality only
Pro ($2X): Core + productivity features
Enterprise ($4X): Core + Pro + compliance/security
```

Rationale: Clear value steps, anchor effect makes Pro seem reasonable.

### Pattern: The "Flat Rate Undercut"

```
Competitor: $Y/user/month
Us: $Z flat (no per-user)
```

Headline: "Same features, [X]% less for teams of 5+"
