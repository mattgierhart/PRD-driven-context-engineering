# [Product Name] · Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Authority & Workflow**

- `README.md` — repository orientation (always read first).
- `PRD.md` — this file. Owns the strategic narrative from v0.1 → v1.0.
- `CLAUDE.md` — agent behavior. Confirms how to implement what this PRD asks for.
- `epics/EPIC-{XX}-<slug>.md` — execution window. Updates IDs created/modified when advancing v0.7+.
- See `README.md` for gate criteria and rituals.

**Template Usage**

1. Replace placeholders (`{}`) with product-specific data.
2. Maintain strict version headers (v0.1 → v1.0). Never delete prior versions; append revisions.
3. Use SoT IDs (BR-XXX, CFD-XXX, etc.) whenever referencing research, rules, or technical decisions.
4. Log lifecycle transitions in the change log table below. Reference EPIC IDs for execution notes.

## v0.5 Red Team Review — Risks & Mitigations

> **ID Note**: RISK-XXX IDs are defined inline in this section, not in a separate SoT file.
> **Scoring**: Each RISK- maps to a scoring category (Market/User/Technical). Score = Impact × Likelihood × Status Weight. See `assets/risk.md` for full scoring reference.
> **Continuous**: This register is a living document. New RISK- entries can be added at any stage (v0.5–v1.0). Update the README Risk Scorecard when entries change.

**Risk Register**

| ID | Scoring | Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Raw | Status | Eff. Score | Mitigation | Linked IDs |
|----|---------|------|--------|------------|-----|--------|------------|------------|------------|

  Impact: High=3, Medium=2, Low=1 | Likelihood: High=3, Medium=2, Low=1
  Raw = Impact × Likelihood
  Status Weights: open=1.0, accepted=1.0, mitigating=0.5, mitigated=0.25, resolved=0.0
  Effective Score = Raw × Status Weight

## v0.6 Architecture — Technical Blueprint

**System Overview**

- Architecture summary referencing TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md (ID: ARC-### if used).

**API Contracts (API-XXX)**

- API-### — {Endpoint purpose} (Method, Auth, Success / Error states)

**Data Model (DBT-XXX)**

- DBT-### — {Table / model} (Primary keys, relationships)

**Integration Notes**

- External dependencies, rate limits, compliance.

**Development Graph — Expected Topology**

The architecture recorded here is the *blueprint graph* — the intended shape the build must match in v0.7. Capture it so the as-built code can be diffed against it:

- **Expected components & boundaries** — the System Overview above, read as a topology: which modules/services exist and which may depend on which.
- **Conformance rules (on ARC- entries)** — structural claims the code can be checked against, e.g. _"the `engine/` layer must not import the UI framework."_ Each becomes a machine verdict (`pass`/`violate`) feeding the `architecture_conformance` readiness dimension. See `SoT/SoT.TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md` and [`docs/DEVELOPMENT_GRAPH.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GRAPH.md).

**Outstanding Work → v0.7**

- {Implementation open question}

---

## v0.7 Build Execution — Plan for Delivery

**EPIC Backlog Overview**
| EPIC | Objective | Lifecycle Impact | Status | Notes |
|------|-----------|------------------|--------|-------|
| EPIC-{XX} | {Outcome} | Advances to v0.{x+1} | 🚧 | {Summary}

**Testing Strategy Snapshot (TEST-XXX)**

- TEST-### — {Scope}
- TEST-### — {Scope}

**Development Graph (As-Built)**

During the implementation loop, the `@implements` / `@verifies` tags on each code unit are harvested into the Development Graph (`status/devgraph.json`), bridging the code back to the specs above. This is what lets readiness measure build-vs-blueprint (`implementation_coverage`) and architecture drift (`architecture_conformance`) — and is the data the **HeartBeat** visualizer renders. See [`docs/DEVELOPMENT_GRAPH.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GRAPH.md).

**Definition of Done**

- [ ] All IDs created/modified logged in EPIC Section 2.
- [ ] README metrics updated via workflow.
- [ ] Coverage thresholds defined.
- [ ] Code traced to specs — every major unit carries `@implements`; `status/devgraph.json` rebuilt; `implementation_coverage` ≥ threshold (no scoped spec left unbuilt).

### Deployment Configuration

Deployment configuration should be established early in v0.7 to avoid late-stage integration issues. Document the following in `SoT/SoT.DEPLOYMENT.md`:

#### Environments
| Environment | Purpose | Trigger | URL Pattern |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Production | Live users | Merge to main | Primary domain |
| Preview/Staging | Pre-merge testing | Pull request | Branch-based URLs |
| Development | Local development | N/A | localhost |

#### Branch Strategy
Define branch naming conventions and their deployment behavior:
- `main` — Production deployments only
- `feature/*` — Preview deployments for testing
- `fix/*` — Preview deployments for bug verification
- `experiment/*` — Preview deployments for exploration (may be abandoned)

#### Quality Gates
Specify required checks before code reaches production:
1. **Automated** — Lint, type checking, unit tests (CI pipeline)
2. **Manual** — Preview deployment smoke test
3. **Optional** — E2E tests against preview environment

#### Platform Configuration
For each deployment target (web, mobile, API), document:
- Hosting platform and tier
- Environment variable management approach
- Build configuration location
- Secrets that require setup (reference `SoT/SoT.DEPLOYMENT.md` Secrets Inventory)

#### Mobile-Specific (if applicable)
- Code signing approach (manual, automated, or managed)
- Beta distribution channel (TestFlight, Play Store Internal, etc.)
- Release tagging convention (e.g., `v1.0.0` for production, `v1.0.0-beta.1` for beta)
