# DEVLAB Project Memory

> **Purpose**: Continuity across sessions. Read at start, update at end.
> **Behavior**: Resets to empty structure on repo fork.

## How to Use Project Memory

1. **Read first**: At session start, load this section before any work
2. **Update always**: At session end, capture patterns, decisions, and open questions
3. **Reference in work**: Cite memory entries when making technical decisions
4. **Harvest patterns**: When a pattern appears 3+ times, flag for skill extraction

## Project Context

**Product**: {Product name when forked}
**Current PRD Stage**: v0.{x}
**Tech Stack**: {Primary technologies}
**Key Constraint**: {Primary BR-XXX constraint}
**Active EPIC**: {Current EPIC-XXX}
