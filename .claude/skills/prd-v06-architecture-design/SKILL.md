# Architecture Design

Position in workflow: v0.5 Technical Stack Selection → **v0.6 Architecture Design** → v0.6 Technical Specification

Architecture defines how your system components connect. This skill transforms stack selections into a coherent system design with explicit boundaries and integration patterns.

## Consumes

This skill requires prior work from v0.3-v0.5:

- **TECH-\* technology decisions** (from v0.5 Technical Stack Selection) — Tech choices become components; Build items become internal services, Buy/Integrate items become external connections
- **RISK-\* risk entries** (from v0.5 Risk Discovery Interview) — High-priority RISK-* entries must have architectural mitigations; drives design decisions on failover, security, scaling
- **FEA-\* feature entries** (from v0.3 Features Value Planning) — Features determine what components must be built; complex features may require distributed patterns
- **ARC-\* existing architecture decisions** (from prior products if brownfield) — Inherited patterns constrain new designs (monolith with microservice, library reuse, auth pattern, etc.)

This skill assumes v0.5 Technical Stack Selection is complete with TECH- entries providing technology foundations.

## Produces

This skill creates/updates:

- **ARC-\* entries** (architecture decisions, status-based) — Decisions for structure, integration, security, performance, data, DevOps with rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences. No confidence scores; decisions have Status: Proposed/Accepted/Superseded
- **System boundary diagram** — Visual representation showing trust boundaries, components, and external integrations
- **RISK-to-Architecture mapping** — Validation showing every high-priority RISK-* has corresponding ARC-* mitigation or explicit acceptance

All ARC- entries should include:
- **Category**: Structure/Integration/Security/Performance/Data/DevOps
- **Context**: What prompted this decision (derived from TECH-/RISK-/FEA- inputs)
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why (not just what)
- **Alternatives Rejected**: Options considered and why not chosen
- **Consequences**: What this enables and constrains
- **Related IDs**: TECH-XXX, RISK-XXX, FEA-XXX references

Example ARC- entry (Structure):
```markdown
ARC-001: Monolith with Module Boundaries
Category: Structure
Context: Team of 2 developers; unclear domain boundaries at v0.6; TECH-001 (Next.js) supports monolith pattern
Decision: Single Next.js application with domain-based module folders (auth/, reports/, data-sources/), clear module interfaces

Rationale:
  - TECH-001 (Next.js) designed for monoliths
  - Avoids ops complexity of microservices
  - Can extract services later when scaling needs emerge
  - Enables fast iteration for MVP

Alternatives Rejected:
  - Microservices: Premature (team too small); adds ops burden
  - Serverless: Harder to share code; cold start latency concerns (impacts UJ-001 response time)
  - Layered monolith: Less clear boundaries; module pattern better for future extraction

Consequences:
  - Enables: Fast iteration, simple deployment, shared state across domains
  - Constrains: Single scaling unit (can't scale auth independently); must be disciplined about module boundaries

Related IDs: TECH-001 (Next.js), RISK-005 (scaling concerns), FEA-001..FEA-020 (all features in one deployment)
Status: Accepted
```

Example ARC- entry (Security, addressing RISK-):
```markdown
ARC-005: JWT with HTTP-Only Cookies
Category: Security
Context: Need session management for authenticated users; RISK-008 (security compliance) and TECH-003 (Clerk auth) guide this
Decision: JWTs stored in HTTP-only cookies, 1-hour expiry, refresh via /refresh endpoint

Rationale:
  - HTTP-only prevents XSS token theft (mitigates RISK-008 surface area)
  - Short expiry limits damage window if token stolen
  - Refresh flow handles long sessions gracefully
  - TECH-003 (Clerk) handles token lifecycle, we just enforce storage pattern

Alternatives Rejected:
  - localStorage: Vulnerable to XSS (RISK-008 violation)
  - Long-lived tokens: Increases risk exposure time (RISK-008)
  - Server sessions: Scaling complexity; would require Redis (not in TECH-)

Consequences:
  - Enables: Stateless auth, horizontal scaling
  - Constrains: Must handle refresh flow in frontend; logout requires token invalidation

Related IDs: TECH-003 (Clerk handles token generation), RISK-008 (security compliance), BR-010 (auth requirements)
Status: Accepted
```


## Architecture Decision Categories

| Category | What It Covers | Example Decisions |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Structure** | Component organization, boundaries | Monolith vs microservices, module structure |
| **Integration** | External service connections | API gateway pattern, webhook handlers |
| **Security** | Auth, authorization, data protection | JWT strategy, role-based access |
| **Performance** | Scaling, caching, optimization | CDN strategy, database indexing |
| **Data** | Storage, flow, consistency | Event sourcing, CQRS, replication |
| **DevOps** | Deployment, monitoring, CI/CD | Container orchestration, observability |

## Design Process

1. **Pull TECH- decisions** — What technologies are we building with?
2. **Pull RISK- constraints** — What must the architecture account for?
3. **Pull FEA- features** — What must the system do?
4. **Define system boundaries** — What's in/out of scope?
5. **Map component relationships** — How do parts connect?
6. **Document integration patterns** — How do Buy/Integrate items connect?
7. **Create ARC- entries** — Record decisions with rationale

## System Boundary Definition

Before designing components, define what's inside and outside your system:

**Inside (Build)**:
- Core business logic
- Differentiating features
- Custom workflows

**Outside (Buy/Integrate)**:
- Authentication provider
- Payment processor
- Email service
- Analytics

**Boundary Questions**:
- Where does data enter the system?
- Where does data leave the system?
- What trust boundaries exist?
- What must be fast vs. can be eventual?

## Component Relationship Patterns

### For Build Components

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Monolith** | MVP, small team, unclear boundaries | Single Next.js app |
| **Modular Monolith** | Growing codebase, clear domains | Modules with defined interfaces |
| **Microservices** | Clear boundaries, scaling needs | Separate auth, billing, core services |

**Rule for MVP**: Start monolith, extract services when you have evidence of need.

### For Buy/Integrate Components

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct Integration** | Simple, trusted service | Call Stripe API directly |
| **Adapter Layer** | Want to swap providers later | Abstract over auth provider |
| **Event Bridge** | Async, decoupled | Webhooks → event queue → handlers |

## Integration Architecture Patterns

### Pattern: Vendor Abstraction

When you Buy a service but want flexibility to switch:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Your Application          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Payment Abstraction Layer     │
│   interface PaymentProvider {       │
│     charge(amount, token): Result   │
│   }                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  StripeAdapter  │  PaddleAdapter    │
└─────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

**When to use**: High switching cost, multiple viable providers, strategic flexibility needed.

### Pattern: Webhook Handler

When integrating with external events:

```
External Service → Webhook Endpoint → Event Queue → Handler
                        ↓
                   Signature Verify
                        ↓
                   Idempotency Check
                        ↓
                   Enqueue for processing
```

**When to use**: External services push events (Stripe, GitHub, etc.).

**Example ARC- entry:**
```
ARC-001: Monolith with Module Boundaries
Category: Structure
Context: Need to choose application structure for MVP launch
Decision: Single Next.js application with domain-based module folders

Rationale:
  - Team of 2 developers, single deployment simplifies ops
  - Unclear domain boundaries at this stage
  - Can extract services later when patterns emerge

Alternatives Rejected:
  - Microservices: Premature; adds ops complexity without proven need
  - Serverless functions: Harder to share code, cold start concerns

Consequences:
  - Enables: Fast iteration, simple deployment, shared state
  - Constrains: Single scaling unit, must be disciplined about module boundaries

Related IDs: TECH-001 (Next.js), RISK-005 (scaling concerns)
Status: Accepted
```

**Example ARC- entry (Security):**
```
ARC-005: JWT with HTTP-Only Cookies
Category: Security
Context: Need session management strategy for authenticated users
Decision: JWTs stored in HTTP-only cookies, 1-hour expiry, refresh via /refresh endpoint

Rationale:
  - HTTP-only prevents XSS access to tokens
  - Short expiry limits damage from stolen tokens
  - Refresh flow handles long sessions gracefully

Alternatives Rejected:
  - localStorage: Vulnerable to XSS
  - Long-lived tokens: Security risk if compromised
  - Server-side sessions: Scaling complexity, Redis dependency

Consequences:
  - Enables: Stateless auth, horizontal scaling
  - Constrains: Must handle refresh flow in frontend, logout requires invalidation strategy

Related IDs: TECH-001 (Clerk handles this), RISK-008 (security compliance)
Status: Accepted
```

## RISK- to Architecture Mapping

Every high-priority risk should have an architectural response:

| Risk | Architecture Response |
|------|----------------------|
| RISK-001: API dependency outage | ARC-010: Add retry + circuit breaker |
| RISK-003: Data breach | ARC-005: Encryption at rest + transit |
| RISK-007: Scaling bottleneck | ARC-012: Cache layer, read replicas |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Signal | Fix |
|--------------|--------|-----|
| **Architecture astronaut** | Over-engineering for 1000x scale | Design for 10x current needs |
| **Missing boundaries** | Everything can call everything | Define clear interfaces |
| **Ignoring RISK-** | Architecture doesn't address risks | Map each High RISK- to ARC- |
| **Vendor lock-in** | No abstraction over critical services | Add adapter layer for switching |
| **Diagram without decisions** | Pretty pictures, no ARC- records | Every box needs documented rationale |
| **Premature microservices** | 5 services for MVP | Start monolith, extract later |

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to Technical Specification:

- [ ] All TECH- Build items have component placement
- [ ] All TECH- Buy/Integrate items have integration pattern
- [ ] High-priority RISK- entries have architectural mitigation
- [ ] Trust boundaries clearly defined
- [ ] Data flow documented
- [ ] ARC- entries created for major decisions

## Downstream Connections

ARC- entries feed into:

| Consumer | What It Uses | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Technical Specification** | ARC- informs API design | ARC-001 (monolith) → unified API surface |
| **v0.7 Build Execution** | ARC- defines EPIC scope | ARC-003 (auth module) → EPIC-02 |
| **Infrastructure Setup** | ARC- drives deployment | ARC-010 (edge caching) → CDN config |
| **Security Review** | Security ARC- entries | ARC-005 → pen test scope |
