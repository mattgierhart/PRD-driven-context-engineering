## Implementation Plan (Claude Code) {#implementation-plan}

### Detailed Development Plan

---

#### Task [ID] - [Task Title]

*   **Status:** `To Do` | `In Progress` | `Done` | `Blocked` | `blocked-for-opus` | `blocked-for-user`
*   **Model Suitability:** `opus-only` | `sonnet-ready` | `either`
*   **User Action Required:** [If blocked-for-user, specify what's needed: API key, business decision, design approval, etc.]
*   **Context:** A brief explanation of *why* this task is necessary, referencing specific audit documents, user stories, or business requirements.
*   **Action Plan:** A clear, high-level description of *what* needs to be done. This serves as the primary instruction for the developer (Claude).
*   **Test First Approach:**
    *   **Tests to Write:** [List specific test files/cases to create before implementation]
    *   **Expected Behavior:** [Define what success looks like]
*   **Implementation Notes:** *(To be filled out by the developer during/after implementation)*
    *   A detailed log of *how* the task was accomplished. This is crucial for documentation and review.
    *   Should include:
        *   Files created or modified.
        *   Key functions, classes, or logic that were added or changed.
        *   Important commands run.
        *   Architectural or implementation decisions made.
    *   **Blockers Encountered:** [If status is blocked-for-opus, detail the issue]
*   **Validation:**
    *   Clear, objective criteria to confirm the task is complete and correct.
    *   Should include:
        *   Specific tests to run (e.g., `npm run test -- src/lib/__tests__/auth.test.ts`).
        *   Expected outcomes (e.g., "All tests must pass," "Lighthouse score for performance must be > 90").
        *   If applicable, manual verification steps.
