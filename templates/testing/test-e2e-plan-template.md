# End-to-End Testing Implementation Plan: {Feature/Journey Name}

## 1. Overview

This document tracks the implementation and results of End-to-End (E2E) tests for {Feature/Journey Name}'s critical user journeys, as defined in EPIC-{XXX}.

## 2. Test Coverage Summary

| User Journey | Target Tests | Tests Written | Tests Passing | Status |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| {Journey 1: e.g., New User Onboarding} | 10 | 0 | 0 | ❌ Not Started |
| {Journey 2: e.g., Core Feature Workflow} | 8 | 0 | 0 | ❌ Not Started |
| {Journey 3: e.g., Cross-Browser Testing} | 6 | 0 | 0 | ❌ Not Started |

## 3. Detailed Test Plan

### 3.1. Critical User Journey: {Journey 1}

*   **Scope:**
    - [ ] Step 1: (e.g., Landing page load and performance < 2s)
    - [ ] Step 2: (e.g., Sign up form validation)
    - [ ] Step 3: (e.g., Email verification flow)
    - [ ] Step 4: (e.g., Initial profile setup)
    - [ ] Step 5: (e.g., Dashboard first view)
*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   *(To be filled out by the developer)*
*   **Test Results:**
    ```
    Test Suite: {Journey 1 Name}
    Total Tests: 0
    Passing: 0
    Failing: 0
    Duration: 0ms
    ```

### 3.2. Critical User Journey: {Journey 2}

*   **Scope:**
    - [ ] Step 1: (e.g., Login to existing account)
    - [ ] Step 2: (e.g., Navigate to feature page)
    - [ ] Step 3: (e.g., Perform core action)
    - [ ] Step 4: (e.g., View and interact with results)
    - [ ] Step 5: (e.g., Logout)
*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   *(To be filled out by the developer)*
*   **Test Results:**
    ```
    Test Suite: {Journey 2 Name}
    Total Tests: 0
    Passing: 0
    Failing: 0
    Duration: 0ms
    ```

## 4. Cross-Platform Coverage

### Browser Coverage Matrix

| Browser | Version | Desktop | Mobile | PWA | Status |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Chrome | Latest-2 | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | ❌ |
| Firefox | Latest-2 | [ ] | N/A | [ ] | ❌ |
| Safari | Latest | [ ] | [ ] | N/A | ❌ |
| Edge | Latest | [ ] | N/A | [ ] | ❌ |

### Browser-Specific Issues
*   *(To be documented during testing)*

## 5. Test Environment Configuration

### Infrastructure
*   **Test Database:** Cloned from a sanitized production snapshot.
*   **Frontend Server:** Staging or dedicated E2E environment.
*   **Backend Server:** Staging or dedicated E2E environment.
*   **External Services:** Can be live (with test accounts) or mocked, depending on the test.

### Test Data
*   **Users:** A pool of pre-configured test accounts with different roles and states.
*   **Documents:** A library of sample files for upload and processing.

## 6. Action Items

1.  [ ] Set up Playwright framework and configure browsers.
2.  [ ] Create test data management system (seeding and cleanup).
3.  [ ] Implement Page Object Models (POMs) for key pages.
4.  [ ] Write E2E tests for {Journey 1}.
5.  [ ] Write E2E tests for {Journey 2}.
6.  [ ] Implement visual regression testing checkpoints.
7.  [ ] Add performance and accessibility checks to the E2E suite.
8.  [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated runs.
