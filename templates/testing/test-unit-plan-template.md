# Unit Testing Implementation Plan: {Module/Feature Name}

## 1. Overview

This document tracks the implementation and results of unit tests for the {Module/Feature Name} as defined in EPIC-{XXX}.

## 2. Test Coverage Summary

| Module / File | Target Coverage | Current Coverage | Tests Written | Tests Passing | Status |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| `{file_path_1}` | 90% | 0% | 0 | 0 | ❌ Not Started |
| `{file_path_2}` | 90% | 0% | 0 | 0 | ❌ Not Started |
| `{file_path_3}` | 90% | 0% | 0 | 0 | ❌ Not Started |

## 3. Detailed Test Plan

### 3.1. {Module 1 Name} (e.g., Authentication)

*   **Test File:** `test/auth.test.ts`
*   **Scope:**
    - [ ] Test case 1 (e.g., JWT token generation and validation)
    - [ ] Test case 2 (e.g., Password hashing and verification)
    - [ ] Test case 3 (e.g., Edge case: invalid inputs)
    - [ ] Test case 4 (e.g., Error handling)
*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   *(To be filled out by the developer)*
*   **Test Results:**
    ```
    Test Suite: {Module 1 Name}
    Total Tests: 0
    Passing: 0
    Failing: 0
    Coverage: 0%
    ```

### 3.2. {Module 2 Name} (e.g., Input Validation)

*   **Test File:** `test/validation.test.ts`
*   **Scope:**
    - [ ] Test case 1 (e.g., Zod schema validation)
    - [ ] Test case 2 (e.g., XSS prevention)
    - [ ] Test case 3 (e.g., SQL injection prevention)
*   **Implementation Notes:**
    *   *(To be filled out by the developer)*
*   **Test Results:**
    ```
    Test Suite: {Module 2 Name}
    Total Tests: 0
    Passing: 0
    Failing: 0
    Coverage: 0%
    ```

## 4. Performance & Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Total Test Execution Time | < 30s | N/A | ⏳ |
| Memory Usage | < 500MB | N/A | ⏳ |
| Test Isolation (No inter-dependencies) | 100% | N/A | ⏳ |

## 5. Action Items

1.  [ ] Set up test environment with proper mocking for all dependencies.
2.  [ ] Write unit tests for {Module 1 Name}.
3.  [ ] Write unit tests for {Module 2 Name}.
4.  [ ] Achieve >XX% test coverage for all targeted modules.
5.  [ ] Integrate unit tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
6.  [ ] Document any critical issues or vulnerabilities discovered.
