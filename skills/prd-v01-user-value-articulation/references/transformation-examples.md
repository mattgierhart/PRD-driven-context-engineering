# Pain → Value Transformation Examples

Worked examples from real PRD work with step-by-step transformation process.

## Example 1: HomeFalcon Customer Support

### Source Pain
**CFD-001** (Tier 2):
> "Called Samsung 3 times about my fridge, spent 2 hours on hold, still don't know if it's under warranty"

### Transformation Steps

**1. Extract pain dimensions:**
| Dimension | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Time lost | 2 hours on hold |
| Uncertainty | "Still don't know" |
| Repeat friction | "3 times" |

**2. Select value unit:** Time (primary), Capability (secondary)

**3. Choose framing:** Capability Unlock — pain includes uncertainty

**4. Write value statement:**
> "Know your exact warranty coverage in seconds, not hours—before you call"

**5. Quantify:** 2 hours → 30 seconds = 240x faster

### Resulting CFD
```
CFD-012: Value Hypothesis — Instant Warranty Knowledge
Type: Value Hypothesis | Source: CFD-001 | Tier: 2
Value: "Know warranty coverage in 30 seconds, eliminating 2+ hours of phone tag"
Quantification: 2 hrs → 30 sec = 240x improvement
Framing: Capability Unlock
```

## Example 2: Digital Signage SMB

### Source Pain
**CFD-001** (Tier 1):
> "USB sticks removed for every update—15-30 min per cycle. Displays don't communicate. Priced for 100+ displays."

### Transformation Steps

**1. Extract pain dimensions:**
| Dimension | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Physical friction | USB removal |
| Time per update | 15-30 min |
| No centralization | "Don't communicate" |
| Price mismatch | "Priced for 100+" |

**2. Aggregate to meaningful number:**
15-30 min × 2-4 updates/week = 60-120 min/week = 4-8 hrs/month
Conservative: 2+ hours/month reclaimed

**3. Choose framing:** Positive Gain + Capability Unlock (combined)

**4. Write value statement:**
> "Update all screens from your phone in 30 seconds, reclaim 2+ hrs/month. Run promotions when traffic peaks."

### Resulting CFD
```
CFD-002: Value Hypothesis — Remote Control + Dynamic Content
Type: Value Hypothesis | Source: CFD-001 | Tier: 1
Value: "Control all screens remotely, reclaim 2+ hrs/month, run time-sensitive promotions"
Quantification: 15-30 min → 30 sec; 2+ hrs/month; dynamic now possible
Framing: Positive Gain + Capability Unlock
```

## Example 3: Compliance Training SMB

### Source Pain
**CFD-003** (Tier 1):
> "58% cite manual processes as barrier. Healthcare: 54 tasks/hire, 15-20 courses/role. OSHA: $165K per violation."

### Transformation Steps

**1. Extract pain dimensions:**
| Dimension | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Admin burden | 58% cite manual |
| Complexity | 54 tasks, 15-20 courses |
| Risk exposure | $165K per violation |

**2. Select value unit:** Risk (primary), Time (secondary)

**3. Choose framing:** Risk Reduction — regulatory context

**4. Write value statement:**
> "Eliminate $165K OSHA exposure with automated role-specific training. Reduce compliance admin 70%."

### Resulting CFD
```
CFD-013: Value Hypothesis — Compliance Risk Elimination
Type: Value Hypothesis | Source: CFD-003 | Tier: 1
Value: "Eliminate $165K risk; 70% admin reduction; audit-ready in <60s"
Quantification: $165K avoided; 70% time; hours → 60 sec
Framing: Risk Reduction + Negative Removal
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Bad | Good |
|---------|-----|------|
| Feature as value | "Automated dashboard" | "Save 3 hrs/week; never miss deadline" |
| No source | "Save 50 hours" | "Reduce from 4.2 calls to 1 call [CFD-###]" |
| Mismatched units | Pain: $165K risk → Value: "2 hrs saved" | Pain: $165K risk → Value: "Eliminate $165K exposure" |
| Vague framing | "Better experience" | "Win disputes 3x more often" |

## Quick Reference Patterns

| Pain Contains | Reach for This Value |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "Hours spent on..." | "Reclaim X hours for [activity]" |
| "Risk of $X penalty" | "Eliminate $X exposure" |
| "We can't..." | "Now able to [X] when [trigger]" |
| "Too expensive for..." | "Access at [fraction] of enterprise cost" |
| "Takes X steps" | "Complete in [X÷N] steps" |
| "Don't know if..." | "Instant visibility into [thing]" |
