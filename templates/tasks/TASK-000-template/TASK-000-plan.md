# TASK-000 Plan

## Objective
- Mirror GitHub Issue #{id} scope exactly.
- Reference EPIC-XX Section 3A entries before writing code.

## Proposed Steps
1. Confirm SoT IDs and lifecycle gate.
2. Implement scoped changes referencing IDs in commits.
3. Update tests + README metrics for the targeted gate.
4. Capture learnings and append to `.ghm/memory.jsonl` if durable.

## Risk / Open Questions
- [ ] List blockers or dependencies.

> Update this plan if the GitHub issue scope evolves. Re-run plan mode if major changes occur.
