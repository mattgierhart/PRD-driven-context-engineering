## Inspiration & Attribution

This tool is part of the **GHM Visualization Suite**, inspired by visual concepts from [Hephaestus](https://github.com/Ido-Levi/Hephaestus), a semi-structured agentic framework by Ido Levi.

**Hephaestus License**: AGPL-3.0
**GHM Visualization Suite License**: MIT (Gear Heart AI, LLC)

We adapted Hephaestus's visualization approaches (dependency graphs, Kanban boards, agent monitoring) to align with Gear Heart Methodology's documentation-first context engineering workflow.

**No code was copied from Hephaestus.** All implementations are original, written from scratch to comply with GHM's MIT license. We gratefully acknowledge the inspiration and design patterns from the Hephaestus project.
