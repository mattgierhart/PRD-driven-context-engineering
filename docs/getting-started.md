# Getting Started with APOLLO

This guide will walk you through your first product build using the APOLLO workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** and npm installed
- **Git** for version control
- **VS Code** or your preferred editor
- **GitHub account** for repository hosting
- **Supabase account** (free tier is fine)
- **Vercel account** (free tier works)

### Install Required CLIs

```bash
# Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Create Next App
npm install -g create-next-app
```

## Your First APOLLO Product

### Step 1: Define Your Product Idea

Start with a clear problem statement:
- Who is your target user?
- What problem are they facing?
- How will your solution help?

### Step 2: Create Your PRD

1. Copy the PRD template:
   ```bash
   cp templates/product/product-PRD-template.md ~/development/products/my-product/my-product-PRD.md
   ```

2. Fill out the initial sections (v0.1):
   - Product vision
   - Target audience
   - Core features

### Step 3: Market Research (Gate 1)

Use the research phase templates to:
- Analyze competitors
- Validate market size
- Confirm revenue potential

**Gate 1 Criteria**: 
- Clear market need identified
- Revenue potential of $1K-$10K/month
- Competitive advantage defined

### Step 4: Technical Planning (Gate 2)

1. Choose your tech stack (usually the APOLLO defaults)
2. Estimate infrastructure costs
3. Create development timeline

**Gate 2 Criteria**:
- Infrastructure <$0.10/user
- Development timeline <21 days
- Technical risks identified

### Step 5: Design Phase (Gate 3)

1. Create user journey maps
2. Design information architecture
3. Generate UI designs (using UXPilot or similar)

**Gate 3 Criteria**:
- Complete design system
- All screens designed
- Responsive layouts ready

### Step 6: Development (Gate 4)

1. **Set up your project**:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-product --typescript --tailwind --app
   cd my-product
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
   ```

2. **Create your EPICs**:
   - Copy the 5 epic templates
   - Break down features into tasks
   - Prioritize MVP features

3. **Implement with TDD**:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement features
   - Run tests continuously

**Gate 4 Criteria**:
- All MVP features complete
- Tests passing
- Performance targets met
- Deployed to production

## Common Workflows

### Daily Development Flow

1. **Morning**: Review EPICs and plan day
2. **Development**: Implement features test-first
3. **Testing**: Run full test suite
4. **Evening**: Update progress in EPICs

### Using AI Assistants

- **Claude Code**: Primary development
- **Gemini**: Strategic reviews at gates
- **Specialized Agents**: Performance, testing, etc.

### Progressive Documentation

Instead of creating new documents:
1. Update existing PRD (v0.1 → v0.2 → etc.)
2. Evolve EPICs as you learn
3. Keep single source of truth

## Tips for Success

### Speed Optimization
- Use existing templates
- Leverage AI for boilerplate
- Focus on MVP features only

### Cost Management
- Start with free tiers
- Monitor usage daily
- Optimize before scaling

### Quality Balance
- "Good enough" for MVP
- Polish after revenue
- Iterate based on feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Join the Community**
   - Star the repository
   - Join discussions
   - Share your progress

2. **Build Your First Product**
   - Start small
   - Ship fast
   - Iterate often

3. **Contribute Back**
   - Share your templates
   - Document learnings
   - Help others

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Development taking too long
- **Solution**: Cut features aggressively, focus on core value

**Problem**: Costs exceeding targets
- **Solution**: Review Supabase usage, implement caching

**Problem**: Failing gates
- **Solution**: Re-evaluate assumptions, adjust scope
